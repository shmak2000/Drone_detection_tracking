# Drone_detection_tracking
Drone detection with yolov8 + tracking with [ByteTrack](https://github.com/ifzhang/ByteTrack) trained on custom dataset <br>
Dataset was collected mostly from youtube videos + the internet and focuses on commercial UAVs like DJI Phantom, Mavic and look-a-likes from Xiaomi and such.
 Contains 3k manually labeled images + 5k unlabeled background images of planes, helicopters and birds.
 For validation I took another dataset, so the test/train data do not intersect.<br>
